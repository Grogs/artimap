# Artimap
TimeOut is a great site to find things to do in a number of cities around the world.

Unfortunately, it's really hard to get an idea of the location of the places listed. 

Artimap displays the places from TimeOut articles on Google Maps.

It's built in Scala, leveraging  akka-http and Scala.js.
